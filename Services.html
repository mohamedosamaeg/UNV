    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Q: I have a medical condition that means my speech might be affected later. Can I record my voice in case I develop difficulties in the future?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes! For those who already have a medical diagnosis but their speech is not yet affected, we recommend Voice Build. You can record your voice now to capture it at its strongest and then download your synthetic voice whenever you’re ready to use it.</p>

    <h3>Q: My speech has already started to deteriorate – can you provide me with ‘my own voice’ for use in a communication aid?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes! Using our Voice Repair service, we’re able to repair speech that is mildly to moderately impaired at the time of recording. Read more about the service <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

   <h3>Q: My speech is now unintelligible – can I still create a personalised synthetic voice?</h3>
   <p>A: Yes! Sometimes speech is too impaired for us to be able to repair it. In this case we suggest you look at Voice Design. This service can be used to create a voice from old recordings of you speaking, or we can use voice donors to create you a bespoke voice. Read more about Voice Design service here.</p>
   <h3>Q: I have never had intelligible speech – can I have a personalised synthetic voice?</h3>
   <p>A: Yes! If you have never had intelligible speech, you can use Voice Design to design your own voice. You can nominate up to 2 people to be your voice ‘donors’ – people who share your desired regional accent, age and gender. We can blend these voices together to create a truly bespoke synthetic voice designed for you, by you. Read more about Voice Design service here</p>
   <h3>Q: What do I need to record my voice?</h3>
   <p>A: You need a computer or laptop, an internet connection and an external microphone to get started.</p>
   <h3>Q: Why do I need to use an external microphone?</h3>
   <p>A: It’s important to use a microphone that plugs in to your laptop/computer. This is because external microphones allow us to capture a much higher quality recording of your voice. The microphone built into your computer and microphones that connect via Bluetooth do not record audio of high enough quality.</p>
